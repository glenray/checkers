    "The Royal Tour Test is designed to measure how close an engine is to solving the Royal Tour Problem. It starts at the last position of the Royal Tour, after white has already won. The engine is asked to search one level deep. Since there are no legal moves, it finds the win immediately. Then the engine is given the next to the last position and asked to search two levels deep. Again, the engine will definitely find the win that is only one move away. The process continues, the positions getting closer to the starting position, and the engines being asked to search more deeply. The process stops if any level takes more than 5 minutes, 300 seconds, to finish.\n",

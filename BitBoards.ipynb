    "Bitboards are an alternative representation of the state of a checker board. A bitboard is a 32 bit word used to represent the 32 legal squares. Each bit is used to represent one element of each square. Each checker board position can be represented with 3 bitboards: black pieces, red pieces, and kings. A bitboard of empty squares can then be derived from ~(red pieces | black pieces).\n",

    "- But see [this](https://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=64487) suggesting that Kreuzer's bitboard was not the best way. That using 43 bit ints would make all pieces move by 4 and 5. Rather than some by 3 and 4 and others by 4 and 5, depending on the rank of the square.\n",
